    "I am going to explore and analyze a provided data set consisting of some 22.000 properties having been sold between May 2014 and May 2015 in the King County district in Washington, USA. What do these data tell us about supply and demand of houses in this area? Is the house's size the main feature to determine the price? Is it worthwhile to invest in renovations? Are there current trends or is a large property ground a determining factor to buy a house? Could some of these indicators help to estimate the development of the house prices in the future?\n",
