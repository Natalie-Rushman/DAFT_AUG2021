# Midterm Project

## Ironhack Bootcamp in Data Analytics, August-October 2021

I am going to explore and analyze the provided data set consisting of some 22.000 properties having been sold between May 2014 and May 2015 presumably in a district in Washington, USA. For this, the following steps are planned to execute:

### Data Cleaning with Pandas
- checking for correct data types
- scaling the mentioned sizes in sqft to m2 for a better understanding in the European market
- reducing the data set to relevant information
- integrating smaller rooms (0.25, 0.5 or 0.75) as proper rooms
- renaming unclear names

### Querying with SQL
Getting a better understanding of the provided data by drowing relationships such as the houses' prices to
- the respective size
- the quality of the building
- the environment.

### Plotting and Preprocessing in Python
Insights from the SQL queries will be plotted in order to get a better idea, some preprocessing is planned:
- correlations
- histograms
- distplots
- normalization
- transformation

## Visualization with Tableau
A final dasboard to display the most intriguing insights would be lovely.

NB: This is a beginner's first try-out.
